/// Takes an image containing Advent of Code's ASCII-art letter representations and converts 
/// it to a standard String.
/// 
/// `image` is a `Scannable,` which is a marker trait that is implemented for the following
/// types:
/// * `&str`
/// * `(&Vec<bool>, usize)`, a tuple consisting of a Vec of bools and the width of a line.
/// * `(&Vec<bool>, usize)`, a tuple consisting of a Vec of chars and the width of a line.
/// * `&Vec<Vec<bool>>`, a Vec of a Vec of bools.
/// * `&Vec<Vec<char>>`, a Vec of a Vec of chars.
/// 
/// For &str and the char-based Vecs, '#' is considered part of a letter and all other chars 
/// are considered blank space. For the bool-based Vecs, `true` is considered part of a 
/// letter and `false` is considered blank space.
/// 
/// # Example
/// 
/// ```
/// let image = r"
/// .##..###...##.
/// ##..#.#..#.#..#
/// ##..#.###..#...
/// #####.#..#.#...
/// ##..#.#..#.#..#
/// ##..#.###...##.
///     ";
/// 
/// let s = ocr(image);
/// assert_eq!(s, "ABC");
